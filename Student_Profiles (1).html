            <h3>Interests:</h3>
            <p>I absolutely love singing and dancing. Whenever there's an opportunity to sing and dance I take it (this might not always be in the most appropriate of places) I enjoy acting as it allows you to express yourself in any way. I enjoy listening to pop music, from Michael Jackson to Backstreet Boys, from Spice Girls to WHAM! I am quite competitive and enjoy playing board games like, Cluedo and Monopoly. </p>
            <h3>Activities Outside School:</h3>
            <p>I attend many clubs outside of school. On a Tuesday evening I attend ballet, on Wednesday I have a private singing lesson. Fridays I attend a musical theatre class, which incorporate dancing, singing and acting. A typical weekend for me is Ballroom and Latin American dancing in the morning followed by a singing class, LAMDA class and a further dance class which covers various styles of dance. Sunday is free for Homework and is our family day together. I have also been recently appointed as a 'Step into Dance Leader' for Hayes School and I am enjoying the Matilda rehearsals at school. I love to perform on stage, no matter the size of the stage I just enjoy expressing myself in many different ways performing allows me to be free and happy. I thoroughly enjoy socialising with my friends outside of school and often arrange a last minute play date!  </p>
            <h3>Special Note:</h3>
            <p>I love to perform! At the age of 6 I made my West End Debut in 'Waitress' at the Adelphi Theatre. At the age of 8 I performed at the Royal Opera house in 'Macbeth' and 'The Magic Flute.' More recently, at the age of 10/11 I performed at the National Theatre in Roald Dahl's 'The Witches.'</p>
            <h3>Learning Tips:</h3>
            <p>I am finding my French lessons quite challenging due to regular disruption in the class. I find I learn best in my History lesson, this is due to the teacher (Mr McCambley) making the lessons fun and engaging. He acts out the slides and teaches through stories. He always gives us that reason as to 'why' we need to complete the learning. He is just a really fun teacher because of the relationships he builds with the students. </p>

Even if they tell me it a couple of times sometimes I still don’t understand it so maybe if they could try teaching it to me in a different way. Sometimes I get told off for talking when I’m asking my partner how to do it if I’ve had my hand up for a long time and the teacher hasn’t come to me. I get worried and feel upset and dumb. Then I might sound like I’m cross. I want to learn but I find it hard.  It could help if teachers could be kind and patient </p>

            <h3>Interests:</h3>
            <p>One of my interests is reading, I am currently reading the entirety of Harry Potter, because I enjoyed them so much when I was younger. I am also reading Lord of the Rings.  Playing piano. I started playing piano in year 5 in Primary School and have really been enjoying it ever since. I'm currently doing my grade two. I also really like gaming. I have a Nintendo Switch and I also play on my laptop. My favourite games are: Roblox, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Hogwarts Legacy. I really like to build and play with Lego. My favourite types of Lego are Lego Harry Potter and Lego Ninjago. I love the feeling of accomplishment after building a big set. </p>
            <h3>Activities Outside School:</h3>
            <p>Recently, I've been starting to do parkrun (a 5k race around Norman Park) and I've really been enjoying it. I always feel so tired at the end but It's a good feeling. I keep getting better times and places every week, so I really want to keep going with it. Something I do outside of school is that I still keep in contact with my old friends from my old Primary school. I went to Stewart Fleming Primary school and I stayed there until the end of year 2, I then moved to Hayes and went to Hayes Primary. I sometimes have sleepovers and meet up with my Stewart Fleming friends. A typical weekend for me would be staying at home, playing games or doing homework. Sometimes my family will go out and we'll have a walk or go out for a run. We also sometimes go into London or Bromley to go shopping.</p>

            <h3>Learning Tips:</h3>
            <p>My favourite teacher is Mr McCambley because I find that he explains everything so clearly and it’s almost like he knows when you don’t understand something and then he role plays it out which makes it a lot easier to understand. I like sitting on the seb one row from the front usually as it helps me concentrate. It’s very similar with books. A year ago I would read book and then wouldn’t remember what I had read but that has improved a lot now but it is similar with where I sit in class.</p>

            <p>I sit at the front of the class for all my lessons or most of my lessons. This is because I am dyslexic. I need to be near the board. Most of my teachers are aware that I’m dyslexic and cater for me by giving me either yellow paper or overlay, this is really helpful. Sometimes it takes me a little bit longer to process the instructions from the teacher, but I’m getting the hang of things and think I’m doing okay</p>

            <h3>Learning Tips:</h3>
            <p>I learn better when the teacher is engaging and made the lesson fun and not us just reading off the board and writing notes. Also in lesson I think it’s good to draw like templates and what we are learning. I find it easier when we have more time to write notes and have a check list of what we should have in our book. And at the end of a lesson if we have watched a video maybe put it on satchel one so we can revise it properly and understand it in our own time.</p>

            <h3>Interests:</h3>
            <p>I am interested in K-pop and pop music, i love Billie Eilish and the Korean band Stray kids. They make me happy when I'm sad. I love playing netball and football because they're always fun sports to play with my friends, as well as swimming. My favourite subject is art because I love being creative and drawing as well as designing outfits and houses. My favourite foods are sushi, ramen, steak, curry and donuts! </p>
            <h3>Activities Outside School:</h3>
            <p>most weekends I am with my family or friends. When I have nothing to do I will normally listen to music whilst tidying my room because when I am finished I like rewarding myself and it makes me feel good after. I normally have my sports clubs during weekdays after school-time. Some weekends or holidays I will go to the park with my family and I like to call my friends as well because they make me feel very happy! Especially the ones who don't go to the same school as me because when I catch up with them I feel exited!</p>
            <h3>Special Note:</h3>
            <p>I am very good at drawing, singing and dancing (even though I don't like to perform much in front of others).</p>
            <h3>Learning Tips:</h3>
            <p>Sometimes in lessons if I don't understand something I would ask my friends or the people around me but other times I am to nervous to ask them or my teacher because I fell that when my friends ask, the teachers will tell them off for not listening and I don't want to cause any trouble. I don't normally get stuck in my lessons and most subjects are okay for me!</p>
